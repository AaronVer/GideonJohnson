// 2/10: Reluctantly, I will have to call this program off. I am unable to get the Test command working
// and perhaps more importantly, I don't really see much use for these commands as a whole. I have always
// debugged perfectly fine by adding output statements into parts of the code to examine the processes
// more closely, I don't see much of a need for these as they're harder to set up, give less
// information, and could potentally add massive amounts of debugging time in order to get the
// annotations to work properly. I have learned in life that you cannot recite everything to memory.
// so a very important skill is having the discretion to know what to memorize and what you can neglect.
// After thinking it over and looking at these, I choose to neglect them.
// Now, I am commenting every line to prevent this from disrupting other programs.

    // Here's my plan. I'm going to attempt to use annotations and similar commands.
    // What I'll do is that I'll import the Zoo package and classes, and then copy sections from
    // other files to here, and test them. That way I will have an idea on what the results should be.

        // It would appear that try statements need their own methods. Since I have no
        // clue what to be bringing into these methods
